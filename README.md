## Background information:
This repository is for Assignment 2 of Elements of Data Processing. Where the task was to analyse books, ratings and user data and create tangible outcomes for bookstore owners.

## Research Question:
How can bookstore owners leverage book rating data to identify patterns in user behavior, predict demographic preferences, and develop personalized recommendation systems to optimize book procurement and improve sales?

## Repository Information:
All coding files are in jupyter notebook format to make it easier to follow thought process and pipeline. \
The repository is broken up into 5 parts:
- data: raw, cleaned and preprocessed data is stored
- eda: exploratory data analysis
- ml: jupyter notebook files for VAT, K-NN and Decision tree analysis
  - run after preprocessing
- preprocessing: Data cleaning of books and users and preprocessing data for decision tree
  - run preprocessing in order:
    -   preprocessing_books.ipynb
    -   preprocessing_users.ipynb
    -   preprocessing_data.ipynb
- specs: assignment guidelines and rubrics
